  body>
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  <hr>
  <p> Welcome to my web page! this is the first example from class. i hope you like it.
  <p> Here´s another paragraph.
  I typed this line without another paragraph tag, so it should appear right next to the previous sentence.
  The web page <b> doesn´t</b> preserve the same spacing.  It formats according to the tags it sees
  so the line
  breaks
  are
  
  
  
  
  
  different from the source
  also. <p><h2> but heres a <i>new</i> paragraph.<h2>
